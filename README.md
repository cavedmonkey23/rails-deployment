# Ruby on Rails Deployment Readme
This readme file provides a comprehensive guide on how to deploy a Ruby on Rails application. It covers various aspects of the deployment process, including setting up a production environment, configuring the application server, database setup, and handling of static assets.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying a Ruby on Rails application, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
1. Ruby (version XYZ) and Rails (version XYZ) are installed.
2. A code repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket) for the application code is available.
3. A hosting provider or server is set up to host the application.
4. Knowledge of basic Linux server administration commands.
## Setting up Production Environment
1. Choose a Ruby version manager (e.g., RVM, rbenv) and install it on the production server.
2. Install the specific Ruby version required for the application.
3. Set up the production environment variables (e.g., database connection details, secret keys) on the server.
4. Install required system dependencies (e.g., JavaScript runtime, database client libraries).
## Configuring Application Server
There are multiple options for application servers in Ruby on Rails. Some popular choices include:
1. **Passenger**: Install and configure Passenger as the application server.
2. **Puma**: Install and configure Puma as the application server.
3. **Unicorn**: Install and configure Unicorn as the application server.
Choose an application server based on your requirements and configure it accordingly.
## Database Setup
1. Install the required database server (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) on the production server.
2. Create a new database for the application.
3. Set up database configuration in the Rails application's `config/database.yml` file.
4. Migrate the database schema using `rails db:migrate` command.
5. Seed the database with initial data if required (`rails db:seed`).
## Handling Static Assets
1. Install a web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to serve static assets in production.
2. Configure the web server to proxy requests to the application server for dynamic content.
3. Enable gzip compression and caching for static assets to optimize performance.
4. Precompile Rails assets using `rails assets:precompile` command before deploying.
## Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Ensure all necessary gems are specified in the application's Gemfile.
- [ ] Remove development/test-specific gems and configurations from the Gemfile.
- [ ] Configure the application server to start automatically on server boot.
- [ ] Configure server logging to capture application logs.
- [ ] Set up a process manager (e.g. systemd, PM2) to monitor and manage the application server.
- [ ] Secure the production server by applying necessary security measures (e.g., firewall, SSH configuration).
- [ ] Test the deployment process by deploying the application to staging environment before production.
## Troubleshooting
- Refer to the application server logs for error messages and exceptions.
- Check the application's database configuration for correct credentials.
- Ensure environment variables are properly set and accessible by the application.
- Verify the file permissions and ownership for the deployed files.
- Search online resources and communities (e.g., Stack Overflow, Ruby on Rails official documentation) for potential solutions.
